## Instalation


To install the Littlebot Gazebo package, follow these steps:

### Create a ROS Workspace:
  Before you begin, make sure you have ROS installed on your system. If you don't have it, you can follow the official [ROS installation guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html) for your operating system. Once ROS is installed, create a new ROS workspace if you don't have one already. You can create a workspace by running the following commands in your terminal:

  ```bash
  # Create a new ROS workspace (replace "littlebot_ws" with your preferred workspace name)
  mkdir -p ~/littlebot_ws/src
  cd ~/littlebot_ws/
  colcon build
  ```
### Clone the Littlebot Packages:
  Navigate to the src directory of your ROS workspace, and clone the **littlebot_gazebo** and **littlebo package** repositories from GitHub:

  ```bash
# Move to the 'src' directory of your ROS workspace
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/

# Clone the Littlebot Gazebo package repository
git clone https://github.com/NestorDP/littlebot_gazebo.git

# Clone the Littlebot package repository
git https://github.com/NestorDP/littlebot.git
  ```
