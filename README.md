## Instalation


To install the Littlebot Gazebo package, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a ROS Workspace:
  Before you begin, make sure you have ROS installed on your system. If you don't have it, you can follow the official [ROS installation guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html) for your operating system. Once ROS is installed, create a new ROS workspace if you don't have one already. You can create a workspace by running the following commands in your terminal:

  ```bash
  # Create a new ROS workspace (replace "littlebot_ws" with your preferred workspace name)
  mkdir -p ~/littlebot_ws/src
  cd ~/littlebot_ws/
  colcon build
  ```
### 2. Clone the Littlebot Packages:
  Navigate to the src directory of your ROS workspace, and clone the **littlebot_gazebo** and **littlebo package** repositories from GitHub:

  ```bash
  # Move to the 'src' directory of your ROS workspace
  cd ~/littlebot_ws/src/

  # Clone the Littlebot Gazebo package repository
  git clone https://github.com/NestorDP/littlebot_gazebo.git

  # Clone the Littlebot package repository
  git clone https://github.com/NestorDP/littlebot.git
  ```

### 3. Build the package:
  After cloning the repository, return to the root of your ROS workspace and build the package using **colcon build**:
  ```bash
  # Move back to the root of your ROS workspace
  cd ~/littlebot_ws/

  # Build the package
  colcon build
  ```
  The build process will compile the littlebot_gazebo and littlebot packages and make it ready for use

### 4. Source the Workspace:
  To ensure ROS can find the littlebot packages, you need to source your workspace. Run the following command:

  ```bash
  # Source the workspace (you might want to add this line to your .bashrc or .bash_profile)
  source ~/littlebot_ws/install/setap.bash
  ```

### 5. Verify the Installation:
  To verify that the package is correctly installed and accessible, you can try running a sample simulation or check if the package is listed among your ROS packages:

  ```bash
  # To check if the package is listed in your ROS packages
  ros2 pkg list | grep littlebot*
  ```
  If the packages are listed, you have successfully installed the Littlebot packages.

  Congratulations! You have now installed the **littlebot_gazebo** package and are ready to explore and simulate your Littlebot robot in the Gazebo environment.
